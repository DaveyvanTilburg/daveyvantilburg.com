programming;/Icons/HeadFirstDesignPatterns.jpg;2016-03-02;2016-04-15;Design Patterns;HeadFirst;A great book, but a childish approach. This was one of the first books handed to me that I found interesting. But due to it lengthy writing style, after some time, I started to skim through it. Not a book I would recommend.

programming;/Icons/CleanCode.jpg;2019-03-07;2019-03-13;Clean Code;Robert C. Martin;The first book I've read on coding. Kind of amazing that it took me about 8 years practicing my profession before studying it. This book gives some insights and discussions regarding why you should spend a tad more time on your code than just 'getting the job done'.

Programming is not simply something I do for my employer, but it is my profession. It is something I own and am responsible of. My expertise makes me a valuable employee and my responsibility is to own my profession on the job. At work, I preform, at home, I sharpen my skill.

Ever since reading this book I've felt a drive change myself to become one of those team members described in these stories. Inspirational, creative and above all free to find positive solutions beter than solutions thought up yesterday.
softskills;/Icons/TheMythicalManMonth.jpg;2019-04-04;2019-04-11;The mythical man-month;Fredrick brooks;Quite an interesting book to say the least. Mostly gave me insight into how development teams back in the day were fastly different from today. Hardware and software were developed hand in hand where today both are more generic. Also, today, to be a software engineer, less expertise is required to get started. For better... or for worse.
programming;/Icons/OODesignPatterns.jpg;2019-04-11;2019-05-13;Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented software;The gang of four;A fun little book to get some insight in some of the building blocks used on OOP. Though I'd say not all are relevant todays day-to-day development. But still a fun read, and trying them out opened my mind for what OO ought to be.
softskills;/Icons/TheCoachingHabit.jpg;2019-04-18;2019-04-22;The coaching habit;Michael Bungay Stanier;This book made me realise that there is helping, and 'helping. Helping, like we usually do, happens by sharing the work load or burden. While coaching is keeping the 'problem' with the person you are coaching, and helping them think. Make them reach new conclusions or solutions on their own without you interfering in their growth.

I've never realised that the subject, or 'domain' I program in requires a different skill set to learn and understand than programming. This book opened up my eyes to a wonderful world of design and information gathering and processing. This book is a gem!

literature;/Icons/AnimalFarm.jpg;2019-09-06;2019-09-13;Animal Farm;George Orwell;An amazing book, not much else to say about it. You are reading two stories in one, while reading this somewhat kiddy book about a farm of talking animals, its entirety is a metaphor for what happened during the soviet union. I loved reading the story, and imagion what the people the animals represented actually experienced.
literature;/Icons/PlatoSymp.jpg;2019-09-14;2019-09-21;Plato’s symposium;Seth Benardete;The story made me think about what drives the human spirit. And I think the story has a fair point that striving for immortality through some meaning has a fair point. I always saw that as finding immortality through children. But an idea (like in V for Vendetta) is a child of the mind. In the long run, if the idea impacts people and changes them... I think that is also a beautiful thing to leave behind.
softskills;/Icons/Peopleware.jpg;2019-10-08;2019-10-23;Peopleware – Productive projects and teams – Third edition;Tom Demarco & Timothy Lister;What an amazing book, its a study about human behaviour in the workplace and how we seem to have distanced ourselfs from what we need as humans to work effectively, and what we 'think' works effectively. This book has made me realise that eventhough the team or managers might want me to work in a certain setting or a certain way, I need to stay true to who I am, because in that comfort I am effective.
literature;/Icons/Sapians.jpg;2019-10-24;2019-12-29;Sapians;Yuval Noah Harari;A very inspiring book about the history of man kind. A true feel of 'what our kind went through to get where we are'. It also helps understand why we seem so divided. As we grew and spread across the world we also grew differently for survivability. Not only through different environments but also time, technology and philosophy.
programming;/Icons/CleanAgile.jpg;2019-11-12;2019-11-19;Clean Agile;Robert C. Martin;Wonderful! I've read a few books and many literature online about agile, but I've never really had quite a book put it to light such as this one. Agile, made to bridge the gap between development and non-development and help optimize interactions and expectations. Like Robert says: the current implementation is far from what Agile intended to be. It seems to be more a 'tool of enforcement' rather than a tool that helps facilitate greater result through clear communication.
softskills;/Icons/ImpactMapping.jpg;2019-11-20;2019-11-22;Impact Mapping;Gojko Adzic;This small book contains a truely amazing perspective of how to map out the product you are developing. I'm sad that I have not been able to put it to practice. But the concept is so simple, it is amazing I have not seen it used as it gives a feeling of involvement, transparancy and clairvoyance.
literature;/Icons/BraveNewWorld.jpg;2019-12-31;2020-01-19;Brave new World;Aldous Huxley;What an adventure! With an unexpected and very deeply philosophical chapter near the end. I had no idea books could be this amazing. I want more like this!

It gives a whole new depth to self improvement and how you can help yourself become a better you. Truely methods to give yourself more control over who you are, and who you want to become.

The methods it describes to achieve this information, and what to do with it is quite insightful. As someone aspiring to be an architect, this book has given me much needed information and inspiration.

programming;/Icons/LegacyCode.jpg;2020-06-02;2020-07-03;Working effectively with legacy code;Michael Feathers;The most valuable thing I got from this book, is that I now realise that all code prone to be Legacy Code, and 'new projects' which are seen as fun and 'maintaining old code' is seen as not fun. But I now realise that It is much more probably that I'll have to work with 'old' code, and I think I've now found a way to see that as a fun challange instead of a uphill battle. I think I've read this book too late in my programming career. I think this would have been a great book to start out with. Would definitely recommand this to novice programmers, but not so much to seniors. In and of itself still a great book with wonderful insights and tips and tricks to make day-to-day work more insightful.

I kind of feel ashamed that it took me this long to realise it might be good to read up it. This is a very well explained and short book to give an insight into the general works and feel of the language. And has helped me allot in understanding what happens underneath the covers.
programming;/Icons/ElegantObjects1.jpg;2020-07-26;2020-08-08;Elegant Objects Vol 1;Yegor Bugayenko;If you want to get your mind blown. Read this. I never really thought 'I had a good graps on OOP', I thought I did, but there were always flaws. Either I could not get my code SRP, or OCP, or some other principle. Or the objects didn't really make sense in some way. But this book... this book changed that. I would recommend EVERYONE, who uses an OOP language and is interested in actually thinking OOP, to read this.

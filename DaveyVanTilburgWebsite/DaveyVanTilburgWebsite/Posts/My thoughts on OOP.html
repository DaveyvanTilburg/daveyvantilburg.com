<h1>My thoughts on OOP</h1>
<h3 class="western">Before we start</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to align the definition of the word &lsquo;concept&rsquo;,
and what it means to me. Googling &lsquo;concept definition&rsquo;
gives the following statement: &ldquo;An abstract idea&rdquo;. To me,
this says that a concept hides the details behind a new &lsquo;shorter&rsquo;
definition (an abstraction). This to me is like the concept
&lsquo;ubiquitous language&rsquo; from the book DDD by Eric Evans. We
derive new words that represent many details without explicitly
stating them.</p>

<h3 class="western">The spark</h3>
<p>After having read &lsquo;Elegant Objects vol 1&rsquo; and partly
through vol 2, something has been nagging my mind. If an object is
the encapsulation of state combined with functionality, therefore
giving meaning to the state, where the code takes premise, doesn&rsquo;t
that mean that a concept &lsquo;Book&rsquo; can never really exist?
Shouldn&rsquo;t it, for example, be &lsquo;SellableBook&rsquo;?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Thoughts</h3>
<p>The reason I think this, from what I derive from Vol 1, is that
there are two flows in code: the declaration of what needs to be
done, and the execution of what is declared. To me things brings up
the perception that from every &ldquo;view&rdquo; or &ldquo;flow&rdquo;,
every concept is viewed in a different light, and therefore meaning
(view being a specific functionality that is expected from the user
of the software).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>Looking at a book and wanting to read it, encapsulates a whole
different meaning than wanting to sell one. ReadableBook will expose
some way to display it to the user, which will load many details from
some data storage. While SellableBook will encapsulate the
combination of some user to whom it is being sold to and maybe some
invoicing. The user (for example) is something ReadableBook does not
care about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>If therefore every object has to adhere to SRP (for me meaning
that it has only one reason to change) it should only be re-used if
the view of the object is exactly the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>The concept &lsquo;Book&rsquo; can be used in many different views
and therefore is prone to explode with functionality (less ways to
construct than functionality it exposes) while the concept
&lsquo;SellableBook&rsquo; can only be viewed one way: to sell the
book. Now there are many ways to bring together the concept of
selling a book (many constructors) but in our system, there probably
is only one way to actually do it: SellableBook.sell().</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>Based on this premise, I come to the logical conclusion that a
repository is not OOP. Rather objects UpdateBook, GetSellableBook,
GetReadableBook and (New/Insert)Book should be the replacement for
repositories (or something similar) &hellip; (maybe factory and
builder fall into this category as well?)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>To work with a repository, you instantiate it based on (probably)
some configuration so that it can do what it needs to do and tell it
to do something, like &lsquo;get(id)&rsquo; (which is then both a
command and a query)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>Rather, if you create an UpdateBook object after receiving the
call from some border layer, you are encapsulating the state as early
as possible and let the object do what it needs to do once you hit
the UpdateBook.update() method. Maybe there are different aspects of
the bigger concept Book that can be updated? Well that just means
there will be more concepts, and thus more objects? Like
&lsquo;UpdateBookPrice&rsquo; and UpdateBookComment. This to me,
seems more inline with Yegor&rsquo;s view of OOP. Which I highly
agree with being more maintainable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>In the past I thought that an object needs to embody &lsquo;real
world objects&rsquo;. Like &lsquo;Book&rsquo;, the only problem with
this is that it does not say what the functionality is that it
encapsulates, the one thing it needs to do, and be the best at and
grow in (otherwise you are saying that the data it encapsulates is
more important than the functionality/code). Therefore I think that
objects need to represent meaning, the concept it encapsulates: what
is the real world object you want to do something with, and what is
it you need to do?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>In this light, I would say that objects are &lsquo;words&rsquo; in
the language of the domain, and need to be seen as concepts. A
concept hides details, but a concept cannot be ambiguous. It means
what it means, and should not mean something else in a different
context, otherwise the language is quite difficult to read and
understand, which makes it less maintainable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Alternative example</h3>
<p>Like the word &ldquo;Pool&rdquo;, this word can mean multiple
things based on context. Which is fine of course if you have many
different domains, and therefore namespaces where the object &ldquo;Pool&rdquo;
exists that encapsulate to do only one thing, and through the
namespace it can be derived what that is (though still this can cause
confusion because the many namespaces can become messy if a higher
concept is using different &ldquo;Pool&rdquo; objects at the same
time)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p>Meaning of a concept should not be ambiguous, otherwise it will
not be reused, or might even be reused for the wrong reason (and thus
will be altered) which will make it become a mutant that grows to
encapsulate some more meaning it was not designed to encapsulate in
the first place.</p>

<h3 class="western">Alternative to Concept</h3>
<p>After having reread and rethink what I&rsquo;ve been trying to
formulate in this post. I&rsquo;m doubting a little if the word
&lsquo;Concept&rsquo; is correct. I&rsquo;ve read in DDD that they
use the word &lsquo;Metaphor&rsquo;. They say that the ubiquitous
language in a Domain is consisted of metaphors. I do not like this
because, to me, this says &lsquo;it is an alternative to&rsquo;:
portraying a story in lesser words. Though this is kind of true, it
doesn&rsquo;t ring right to me, as it says nothing about
conceptualizing and evolving. The word &lsquo;Compound&rsquo; comes
to mind (after having seen Breaking Bad), as its definition is &lsquo;A
thing that is composed of two or more separate elements; a mixture&rsquo;.
Which to me sounds more correct to formulate what the words of
ubiquitous language represent, but it does not state that they
together represent some new meaning. Tires, frame, steering wheel
etc. together compound to a car. But the concept of a car does not
have to be &lsquo;created&rsquo; in order to be real.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Concept vs Compound</h3>
<p>I Favor &lsquo;concept&rsquo; for ubiquitous language because the
language represent the unrealized ideas, where the objects are
compounds. Objects are the things that are initialized and stored
somewhere to be used. They are physical, where the blueprints (in C#
they are classes) represent what they aught to be. The blueprint is
an entirely different &lsquo;thing&rsquo; than what is created based
off of it.</p>

<h3 class="western">Architecture</h3>
<p>From books about architecture (sources being &lsquo;Designing
software architectures&rsquo;, &lsquo;Software architecture in
Practice&rsquo;) I&rsquo;ve seen the authors referencing a book about
building architecture (I can&rsquo;t find it at the time of writing
this post, If I do come across it again, I will update). In this book
it is described that everyone sharing the same language knows what a
&lsquo;Kitchen&rsquo; is. Yet, when applied, every Kitchen in the
world has fast amounts of differences. This, is the difference
between &lsquo;Concept&rsquo;, the language we use, and &lsquo;Compounds&rsquo;,
the realizations based on concepts with slight or mayor variations.</p>

<h3 class="western">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think OOP in and of itself is a wonderful paradigm to view the
work software developers do. The &lsquo;World&rsquo;/&rsquo;Domain&rsquo;/&rsquo;Language&rsquo;
you are creating as a software developer. I find new ideas in order
to structure, contemplate about, gather information about and develop
the way I work fascinating. My thoughts in this post are not
absolute. Hopefully in due time I learn about something new that
shifts and evolves my view into something even more wonderful.</p>

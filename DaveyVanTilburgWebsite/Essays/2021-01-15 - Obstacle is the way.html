Essay on the book &ldquo;Obstacle is the way&rdquo;</h1>
<h3 class="western"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>Perception</b></font></font></h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I think I would like
to start with saying that this book has a lot of great knowledge
based on historical figures that describe a great deal about
stoicism. It&rsquo;s point about that the first thing that you can
do, is to &ldquo;see that which is preventing you from doing what you
want to do as the objective thing for what it really is&rdquo;, and
not the subjective experience of it blocking your way.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">For example: 
</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If you take the same
path to work everyday, but on one day suddenly the road is blocked
due to reconstruction. See it for what it really is. This event has
nothing to do with you, even though it has an impact on you. Yes, you
are suddenly faced with a challenge which you have to solve &ldquo;What
path can I take now that will take me to my work&rdquo; and get
stressed because &ldquo;will I get there in time?&rdquo; which might
challenge your values of &ldquo;being punctual&rdquo; which then also
challenge your ego which causes an uproar of emotion. But it is not a
challenge specifically designed to cause you inconvenience. Rather,
objectively, other people are working to make the road better, which
is their goal, it just happened to intersect with your goal. And this
will impact your path, and you, a human with a limited awareness of
the world, could not for see this challenge on your path.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Action and will</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Second, his point on
taking action and finding the right will to put behind the action to
make sure it is not only the right action but you will also see it
through. Is something I would describe slightly different. The &ldquo;will&rdquo;
as Ryan describes it is something that is quite abstract, we all feel
it sometimes, but it is hard to put into words. My description of
will: &ldquo;Having an idea that depends on your most fundamental
values and believes&rdquo;. Because I think that once that case is
true, and you can articulate them accurately, nothing will hold you
back. Though if you are deprived of life&rsquo;s many experiences,
you may seem like a person without a backbone, without a will. You
may not have refined values and believes which you can use to put
behind ideas and so I think that reading, thinking and contemplation
are fundamental to train your spirit, and thus build up a &ldquo;will&rdquo;
as a consequence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">And I think that to
have grown up in a religious family that wishes to pass on the values
and believes the religion upholds is a good way to make sure that the
next generation has a good foundation of values and believes to put
behind action. And if many people share the same set of values and
believes, cohesion and synergy should come forth. This is also the
reason why having a &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; or &ldquo;multi
religious&rdquo; country might be a bad idea if no bridges are
created between these groups that uphold different sets of values and
believes.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">A different perspective</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">But having read the
whole book I would say that there is also a different way of
describing the same idea the book is trying to explain. I think
seeing things that block your path in and of itself is the wrong way
of addressing that which is happening. Its the wrong paradigm.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Let&rsquo;s start
off with that, describing the paradigm I extract from the book. You
are a human, and a human needs to have goals. And upon setting out to
accomplish your goals you are faced with obstacles that will make it
more difficult to accomplish your goal. Or in the way Ryan describes
it: obstacles that block the path you are trying to walk towards your
goal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">But this also kind
of says that first of, the path you choose is the perfect solution,
and by some random chance or &ldquo;fate&rdquo; things appear on your
path that prevent you from reaching your goal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Let me start about
the word &ldquo;fate&rdquo; first. The definition of fate is: &ldquo;the
development of events outside a person's control, regarded as
predetermined by a supernatural power.&rdquo;. Or&hellip; you could
see &ldquo;fate&rdquo; as this: &ldquo;The world is a fast and
complex object moving through time that is both in the physical plane
as well as the &lsquo;conceived&rsquo; mental/awareness plane.
Everywhere in this world both cognitive and elemental entities are
making goals and working towards them. And in doing so change the
form of the world through time. Fate being that every single entity
in this world only has a limited awareness of that world and is only
confronted with events once they reach their awareness&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In this definition
you are one of the cognitive entities that is making plans and
working towards them, but can only make steps for the limited
knowledge of things within your awareness. This also says that you
should not see yourself as a perfect being that can &ldquo;plan out
every step&rdquo; but as a being that is &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; in the
sense that you do not know everything. Once that is accepted and made
fundamental you can see that every step that is coming your way that
you did not plan for, was a step you did not realize was there on
your way towards your goal.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">For example:</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am a software
engineer and I am often confronted with the following scenario. Say I
have a project and when planning out I discover steps A, B and C,
making D the goal. Since A is close to my current point in time and
space I made the correct assumptions and step A goes as planned. The
same goes for step B which makes for good momentum in working towards
goal D. But now I reach step C, step C being much further away in
time and space from the starting point A and in doing so I had a much
lower resolution chart of what was to come, and made a few wrong
assumptions. When arriving in such a scenario, I usually get
emotional. Getting frustrated or angry with thoughts like &ldquo;my
previous steps were all good, so this one must be good too&rdquo; or
&ldquo;I am so close, just push through and make step C work&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">But that is me
holding on to the believe that &ldquo;my plan was perfect&rdquo; by
staying in the &ldquo;acting&rdquo; phase of the project, and not
shifting back to the &ldquo;planning&rdquo; phase, because doing so
says that my initial plan has to be updated to be effective with the
current (newly gained) knowledge.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If it is part of
your fundamental believes that the goal is always at the end of a
series of steps, but the series of steps are at best a prediction,
open to renewal along the way. Then what would have happened in the
previously described scenario was the following: I feel emotions that
say that the planned step does not match the situation in front of
me. So I need to redefine the plan by updating, removing or adding
steps. Maybe, C was not C, and D was not D. Maybe, C and D were D and
E and a new step C should be added to the chain. A step I could not
see when I was planning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This is what I think
is the best way to handle anything along the way towards your goal,
what ever happens that is unexpected, is simply that, unexpected. And
it was along your path towards your goal all along, you just were not
aware of it yet.</p>

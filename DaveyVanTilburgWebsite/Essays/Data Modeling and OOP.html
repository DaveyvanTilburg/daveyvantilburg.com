Some thoughts after reading NoSQL and SQL Data Modeling</h1>
<h3 class="western"></h3>
<h3 class="western"></h3>
<h3 class="western">Value vs state and data</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Value: in the eyes
of the beholder. A flashlight can be a source of light in the
darkness, or something annoying a child can blind you with.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">State: the state of
an object. A flashlight is &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Data: the boolean
value &ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;false&rdquo; deprived from further
meaning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When extracting the
state of an object, it becomes data. Data, for example the numerical
value 27 becomes meaningless without its context. Knowing that it
refers to the age of a person gives it meaning. Value is derived from
the state of an object, along with many other factors that give it
&ldquo;body&rdquo;.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><b>Software vs hardware</b></h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Software is the
generic extension of hardware. Hardware are specific purpose devices
that need to be aligned in order to have a function or meaning. But
doing so requires allot of effort, so software was invented. A softer
form of &lsquo;ware&rsquo; than &lsquo;hard&rsquo;ware. Software
objects are like hardware objects in that it extends the meaning of
hardware interactions through software objects.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Software objects are
higher level components where hardware objects are the lowest in any
&lsquo;software&rsquo; hierarchy. Software objects give live to
hardware objects by giving meaning to the meaningless generic
hardware.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Software development
therefore is an extension of hardware development. Software objects
therefore also need to be development with the same care and design
in mind as hardware objects.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Sharing the same vocabulary</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
After having read this book I&rsquo;ve become very interested in my
own vocabulary and if I use words that have vague meaning. I am
focusing allot more on what I say these days, and if the same
definition of a word is shared with both speaker and listener to make
sure the actual message is transmitted. And not misinformation due to
vagueness in terms.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
I think it is very important to use the correct terms, and choose
your words. I&rsquo;ve also seen this in different books like &lsquo;12
rules for life&rsquo; where Jordan B. Peterson in his chapter &lsquo;tell
the truth &ndash; or at least, don&rsquo;t lie&rsquo; emphasizes both
the truth of words, as well as carefully selecting the words you
speak.</p>
<h3 class="western"><br/>
<br/>

</h3>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-before: always">Propositions,
data and predicate</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In the logical
world, a proposition has the following definition: &ldquo;a statement
that expresses a concept that can be true or false.&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Predicate has the
following definition: &ldquo;Found or base something on&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">And from this book I
would like to use the definition for data: &ldquo;Information
deprived of meaning or context&rdquo;</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Data Object</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-weight: normal">A</span><span style="font-weight: normal">n
object to reconstitute information from data </span><span style="font-weight: normal">for
the purpose of display. Since &lsquo;data&rsquo; can only be &lsquo;data&rsquo;
when the context it belongs to is known, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">I
think data objects make perfect sense, but only when the data it
transfers is used for display purposes. Which to me means it is used
to reconstitute information </span><span style="font-weight: normal">in
some presentation form.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Propositional objects</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
An object to assert if a proposition is true or false. I think this
type of object makes perfect sense in the world of OOP. Instead of
all these comparisons which are full of details. Encapsulating the
data and the comparison and giving more context by wrapping it into
an object will simplify the code base and therefore open up allot
more space for new discoveries.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
(By hiding the details, there is less cognitive load when analyzing
the code, this means that more mental space is open for new
discoveries)</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">SQL vs NoSQL</h3>
<p>I think the following statement is true:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-weight: normal">NoSQL
databases are</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> only for
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">situations where</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
you have a large diversity of relations with little data and at the
same time you wish to query </span><span style="font-weight: normal">that</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
data.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
Both SQL and NoSQL can be ACID or BASE. ACID and BASE are not related
to the data that is stored. But the quality of the data.</p>

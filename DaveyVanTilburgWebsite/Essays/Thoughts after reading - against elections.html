Thoughts after reading: against elections 
</h1>
<h1 class="western" align="center">(tegen verkiezingen)</h1>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This is
not going to be a very insightful writing, because I think the book
already does a very very good job of it. But I did have some thoughts
and notes I wanted to note down for myself:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">First
of, I found a commonality between &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;
Agile being from my programming world where the misconception is
sometimes made that Agile and Scrum are things from the same set,
which they are not. In a sense the same is being done to the word
&ldquo;Democracy&rdquo;. See, Agile is a vision, for me that means it
is a set of values, values we wish to uphold in our acts. But this is
more of a low resolution image of how such acts will actually be.
They do not describe the actual acts. Scrum and Kanban do, they are
high resolution methodologies that describe exactly how to act, but,
they are derived from the low resolution vision : Agile.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
same, I think, can be said for Democracy. Democracy being the vision,
and (for the Netherlands and USA) Electoral-representative democracy
being its currently executed form, or methodology. Democracy, being:
Demos (people) Kratos (strength/power/rule)  means that the people
are empowered, or the people rule. In the book there is a fine quote
saying that a property of true freedom is to rule and be ruled. Not
simply choose who will rule. Where being drawn is a very true
property of democracy as it enforces a way of giving power to a
random subset instead of a few &lsquo;skilled&rsquo;, elections being
more of a property of aristocracy as it says &ldquo;these subset of
people are skilled, please choose among them who will rule you&rdquo;
or at least, that is what it will come down to, because only those
most favorable will belong to the subset, and everyone is open to
being persuaded by strong words that mean nothing.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Then, a
beautiful quote, that for me also describes something powerful about
something I felt during my youth, from Mahatma Gandhi: Everything you
do for me, without me, is against me.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">This
quote is pretty much what the government is about (again, for the
Netherlands and USA) at this moment. Because everything is done from
a &ldquo;protective parent&rdquo; (ruler), for its &ldquo;weak
impotent&rdquo; child (people), or at least, that is how I view it,
because if the ruling class did not see the people as such a weak
impotent child then I think they would include them (us) much more,
and delegate important discussion much more, rather than saying that
they do not belong in &ldquo;public discourse&rdquo; as it will be
detrimental, &hellip; (to them and their future).</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Also
something very insightful is that the methodology used to implement
Democracy needs to be aligned with the technology of the time,
especially technology that influences communication. As throughout
history, technological advances that improve, or make communication
more readily available for the masses, has influenced the efficacy
and legitimacy of the methodology used by the ruling class.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Thus it
should be an important note that every time an advance is made in
communication or connection between people, the methodology used to
&ldquo;rule&rdquo; needs to be updated.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I used
to thing a referendum was a good tool to use to get an idea of what
the populous think about a certain subject. But from a new idea from
the book I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that a referendum is a
stupid idea. You cannot expect the whole of the populous to dig into
a new field of study and come up with a grounded answer within a
short amount of time, that will actually be beneficial to the
discussion.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Instead,
a deliberative way combined with drawing should be implemented to at
random select a subset that represents to whole populous should be
selected and given all and every source of information to study a the
field in question to give a grounded answer for the pro&rsquo;s and
con&rsquo;s for a certain decision, give that document again to
another subset of the populous and give the same resources in order
to make a decisive vote. If such a process was in place and we would
still be where we are at today, then I would feel differently about
where we are. Because that would mean that there is a true consensus
among us we can change through discourse. Instead of &ldquo;the
stupid ruling class having their own bias at play&rdquo; which is the
feeling, I think, most of us have today. And a reason why we do not
trust our ruling people.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Then,
one final though I had while reading this. I think, is very important
for our ruling class. If you have the attention of your people, you
are doing it wrong. Attention is costly, you do not get attention
without reason. Especially in a position of importance. If you get
the attention of your people, you have to see it as a sign of
importance, even if that attention is given negatively, like through
riots. It means, there is something they know, that you might not
know. They give your their attention, because they think differently.
Even though you might actually think the same, but communicate it
differently. To seek out understanding is of the highest good.
Instead of pushing the people aside like rubbish and distrustful
bunch.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Treat
attention with the dignity and sincerity it deserves to build trust
to the people you are responsible for (in an oligarchy) and build
legitimacy. But I guess, the same can be said for any hierarchy, like
a manager or a chaos. Tension, is not a reason for hate, distrust or
fear. It is a reason for attention, love and understanding.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Anyone
not able to understand that, is a child, an egotistical man-child,
someone seeking validation and security it cannot attain from within
and enforces without, and should NOT RULE OR HAVE RESPONSIBILITY OVER
OTHERS <i>(in my opinion&hellip;)</i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
Attention = concern, involvement</p>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
If that is expressed in a positive way, or negatively</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
Eyes on me, is a chance to reflect</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
Eyes on me, sad or happy, means that others see something in me,

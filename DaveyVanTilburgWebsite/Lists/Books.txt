1;false;programming;/Icons/HeadFirstDesignPatterns.jpg;Design Patterns;HeadFirst;A great book, but a childish approach. This was one of the first books handed to me that I found interesting. But due to it lengthy writing style, after some time, I started to skim through it. Not a book I would recommend.

6;false;programming;/Icons/CleanCode.jpg;Clean Code;Robert C. Martin;The first book I've read on coding. Kind of amazing that it took me about 8 years practicing my profession before studying it. This book gives some insights and discussions regarding why you should spend a tad more time on your code than just 'getting the job done'.

8;true;programming;/Icons/TheCleanCoder.jpg;The Clean Coder;Robert C. Martin;This amazing short book has given me new insights on how to look at my passion. Programming is not simply something I do for my employer, but it is my profession. It is something I own and am responsible of. My expertise makes me a valuable employee and my responsibility is to own my profession on the job. At work, I preform, at home, I sharpen my skill.

7;false;softskills;/Icons/SCRUM.jpg;SCRUM - The art of doing twice the work in half the time;Jeff Sutherland;This book didn't inspire me as much to get into SCRUM as much as it gave me insight into stories of how cohesive teams cooperate and make great software. Ever since reading this book I've felt a drive change myself to become one of those team members described in these stories. Inspirational, creative and above all free to find positive solutions beter than solutions thought up yesterday.
5;false;softskills;/Icons/TheMythicalManMonth.jpg;The mythical man-month;Fredrick brooks;Quite an interesting book to say the least. Mostly gave me insight into how development teams back in the day were fastly different from today. Hardware and software were developed hand in hand where today both are more generic. Also, today, to be a software engineer, less expertise is required to get started. For better... or for worse.
6;false;programming;/Icons/OODesignPatterns.jpg;Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented software;The gang of four;A fun little book to get some insight in some of the building blocks used on OOP. Though I'd say not all are relevant todays day-to-day development. But still a fun read, and trying them out opened my mind for what OO ought to be.
7;false;softskills;/Icons/TheCoachingHabit.jpg;The coaching habit;Michael Bungay Stanier;This book made me realise that there is helping, and 'helping. Helping, like we usually do, happens by sharing the work load or burden. While coaching is keeping the 'problem' with the person you are coaching, and helping them think. Make them reach new conclusions or solutions on their own without you interfering in their growth.

10;true;programming;/Icons/DDD.jpg;Domain driven design;Eric Evans;One of the most inspiring books I've read. I've never realised that the subject, or 'domain' I program in requires a different skill set to learn and understand than programming. This book opened up my eyes to a wonderful world of design and information gathering and processing. This book is a gem!

9;true;literature;/Icons/AnimalFarm.jpg;Animal Farm;George Orwell;An amazing book, not much else to say about it. You are reading two stories in one, while reading this somewhat kiddy book about a farm of talking animals, its entirety is a metaphor for what happened during the soviet union. I loved reading the story, and imagion what the people the animals represented actually experienced.
7;false;philosophy;/Icons/PlatoSymp.jpg;Plato’s symposium;Seth Benardete;The story made me think about what drives the human spirit. And I think the story has a fair point that striving for immortality through some meaning has a fair point. I always saw that as finding immortality through children. But an idea (like in V for Vendetta) is a child of the mind. In the long run, if the idea impacts people and changes them... I think that is also a beautiful thing to leave behind.
8;true;softskills;/Icons/Peopleware.jpg;Peopleware – Productive projects and teams – Third edition;Tom Demarco & Timothy Lister;What an amazing book, its a study about human behaviour in the workplace and how we seem to have distanced ourselfs from what we need as humans to work effectively, and what we 'think' works effectively. This book has made me realise that eventhough the team or managers might want me to work in a certain setting or a certain way, I need to stay true to who I am, because in that comfort I am effective.
8;false;literature;/Icons/Sapians.jpg;Sapians;Yuval Noah Harari;A very inspiring book about the history of man kind. A true feel of 'what our kind went through to get where we are'. It also helps understand why we seem so divided. As we grew and spread across the world we also grew differently for survivability. Not only through different environments but also time, technology and philosophy.
8;true;programming;/Icons/CleanAgile.jpg;Clean Agile;Robert C. Martin;Wonderful! I've read a few books and many literature online about agile, but I've never really had quite a book put it to light such as this one. Agile, made to bridge the gap between development and non-development and help optimize interactions and expectations. Like Robert says: the current implementation is far from what Agile intended to be. It seems to be more a 'tool of enforcement' rather than a tool that helps facilitate greater result through clear communication.
6;false;softskills;/Icons/ImpactMapping.jpg;Impact Mapping;Gojko Adzic;This small book contains a truely amazing perspective of how to map out the product you are developing. I'm sad that I have not been able to put it to practice. But the concept is so simple, it is amazing I have not seen it used as it gives a feeling of involvement, transparancy and clairvoyance.

8;true;softskills;/Icons/7Habits.jpg;The 7 habits of highly effective people;Stephen R. Covey;This book, like 12 rules for live I've read last year is amazing. It gives a whole new depth to self improvement and how you can help yourself become a better you. Truely methods to give yourself more control over who you are, and who you want to become.

I never quite understood what the difference was between software architecture and software design. This book has made that quite clear. The methods it describes to achieve this information, and what to do with it is quite insightful. As someone aspiring to be an architect, this book has given me much needed information and inspiration.

5;false;programming;/Icons/LegacyCode.jpg;Working effectively with legacy code;Michael Feathers;The most valuable thing I got from this book, is that I now realise that all code prone to be Legacy Code, and 'new projects' which are seen as fun and 'maintaining old code' is seen as not fun. But I now realise that It is much more probably that I'll have to work with 'old' code, and I think I've now found a way to see that as a fun challange instead of a uphill battle. I think I've read this book too late in my programming career. I think this would have been a great book to start out with. Would definitely recommand this to novice programmers, but not so much to seniors. In and of itself still a great book with wonderful insights and tips and tricks to make day-to-day work more insightful.

7;false;programming;/Icons/C8.jpg;C# 8.0 Pocket reference;Joseph & Ben Albahari;This is the first time I read anything about the language I've worked in since I've started my career in software development. I kind of feel ashamed that it took me this long to realise it might be good to read up it. This is a very well explained and short book to give an insight into the general works and feel of the language. And has helped me allot in understanding what happens underneath the covers.
9;true;programming;/Icons/ElegantObjects1.jpg;Elegant Objects Vol 1;Yegor Bugayenko;If you want to get your mind blown. Read this. I never really thought 'I had a good graps on OOP', I thought I did, but there were always flaws. Either I could not get my code SRP, or OCP, or some other principle. Or the objects didn't really make sense in some way. But this book... this book changed that. I would recommend EVERYONE, who uses an OOP language and is interested in actually thinking OOP, to read this.
10;true;softskills;/Icons/Quiet.jpg;Quiet;Susan Cain;For as long as I can remember I am not comfortable with how I function and my temperament. This book has given me huge amounts of information and things to think about on the intricacies of how introverts come to be, and how to grow up in this modern world. I am a huge introvert, so this book speaks allot to me. I think this book will help me take a step in the right direction on being a better, and especially more happy, 'me'.
7;false;programming;/Icons/ElegantObjects2.jpg;Elegant Objects Vol 2;Yegor Bugayenko;Vol 1 was very inspirational, Vol 2 continues the debate started in Vol 1 and gives new insight into why and how. Though I think it is not as impactful as Vol 1, it does give the discussion more body.
9;true;literature;/Icons/1984.jpg;1984;George Orwell;It's a scary book, very scary if you truly try to envision what a world like 1984 would be like to live in. And, that some of the aspects of the world described in this book actually either exist or are very near coming into existence.

6;false;literature;/Icons/TheOldManAndTheSea.jpg;The old man and the sea;Ernest Hemingway;If you invest more than your 'normal' or 'comfortable' amount of time, skill and energy to procure something of great value, be prepared to guard it against the world if you have it out on display. If you lose it, it will require the same amount of investment again. The pain of loss scales with the investment, especially of you overindulge. Hone skills, acquire resources and invest wisely to reach your goals safely and repeatable if you value the goal. Reflect often if you do decide to invest if it is time to stop. Having invested does not mean you have to see it through to the end. It is stronger to accept 'defeat' than to risk everything.
8;false;programming;/Icons/Sql-nosql.jpg;NOSQL and SQL data modeling;Ted Hills;Eventhough a majority of the book is about data modeling, there are some interesting side concepts described on which data modeling is based. Like 'choosing more meaningful words' (which I also know from '12 rules for life'), and how software is an extension for hardware, by providing meaning to general purpose hardware.

9;true;philosophy;/Icons/Ego.jpg;Ego is the enemy;Ryan Holiday;Reading this book is quite a confrontation. It makes you think about the true underlying motivation in day to day actions, but most of al, "natural" responses to challenging situations. Not just challenges of skill, but also of character. This book has really put up a mirror infront of my face, and I will take this information with me for the rest of my life.
8;true;philosophy;/Icons/Obstacle.jpg;Obstacle is the way;Ryan Holiday;This is a very nice book that describes stoicism. It inspired me to write an essay (2021-01-15)
7;false;literature;/Icons/Corona.jpg;Corona vals alarm?;Sucharit Bhakdi, Karina Reiss;I think, to avoid any negativity on this topic, it is better to converse on this topic than to give my opinion through this one way medium. I think this is true for me, because politic and their implementation types, their views, and pandemics and the history thereof, is new to me. So my thoughts are not refined and as precise as I wish them to be. So in a dialog, it is possible to refine and evolve my thoughts, which I think is better than to formulate my thoughts in a slightly raw manner here and to have to maintain them across time.
9;true;philosophy;/Icons/Stillness.jpg;Stillness is the key;Ryan Holiday;Again an amazing book by Ryan Holiday. Having read his (so far) trilogy on aspects of life, I've come to realize that these books are a very good addition to your mental and physical well being if you have read 12 rules for life from Jordan Peterson. At least, this is how I experience it. Jordan Peterson's vision of life and the responsibilities you have to take as an individual Being places the round foundation, upon which the books of Ryan Holiday build a structure that give details on how to further progress yourself. Stillness is the key, might be one of those books that would help everyone in this modern age, I have come to realize that luckily I was walking the 'right path', but this book makes it just a tad cleaner and nicer. Especially the finishing chapter of his book 'On the final act' is not only about the ending of the book, but also life. Since death is the ultimale stillness, incorporate stillness in our day in order to prolong a happy and virtues life, instead of racing towards an unvolantary stillness.

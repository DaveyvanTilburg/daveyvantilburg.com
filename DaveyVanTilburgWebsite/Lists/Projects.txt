/ProjectIcons/WebsiteIcon.png;My website;https://github.com/DaveyvanTilburg/daveyvantilburg.com;This project has two goal, firstly, I wish to document things for myself. Things I deem important to look back on and review or have as a reminder. How this will manifest itself on this website will probably shift over time. Secondly, I wish to have a project with a goal to give myself practical experience with facets that I have not been exposed to 'on the job'. So far, I have never used MVC and wished to give that a go!

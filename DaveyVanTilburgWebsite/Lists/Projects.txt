/ProjectIcons/challenge_data_reporting.jpg;Challenge data reporting;https://github.com/DaveyvanTilburg/challange_data_reporting;This project was initialized as a request from one of the companies I wish to work for (maybe am?). The challenge was quite simple, there was a data set in a CSV file which had to be read and exposed in such a way that it can be used to create a chart with HighCharts. There were several 'hidden' challenges which I may have taken for granted. Such as that the CSV file wasn't valid CSV which I simply fixed in code. Maybe that should have been a point for discussion, of which the consequences are that if the code fixes it, something 'faulty externally becomes part of the product', or of course the CSV file gets delivered with valid data. Which would lighten the load at processing time. And some ambiguity in the description of the project which I used to make the project fun by adding details of my own instead of asking questions. So on that part, I didn't take is as seriously as I maybe should have. But all in all I had allot of fun working on it, and added allot of challenge of my own which you can read in the readme for the github.

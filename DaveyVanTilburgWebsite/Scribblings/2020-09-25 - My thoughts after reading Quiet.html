<h3 class="western">Over/under stimulated differences between intro
and extraverted</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt quite easily overwhelmed by outside
stimulation, it makes my head spin with thoughts and drains my energy
so fast I get agitated by fatigue combined with the perceived
expectation that &lsquo;I should not be so agitated at some &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
or otherwise &ldquo;happy&rdquo; event&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve always seen
myself as having this social &lsquo;money&rsquo;. Of which I have
some allowance I can spend until I am out, then I have to earn some
more by getting some &lsquo;Me&rsquo; time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Now mostly this is quite accurate. But I did not realize that
there is a difference between social interactions where I am not
overstimulated, and events where I am. I saw all social interactions
as &lsquo;expending the social money&rsquo;. But It actually is only
the social interactions that are overstimulating. Understanding this
gives me two things. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Firstly, since Covid-19 I&rsquo;ve been working from home and this
has changed the world for me. I&rsquo;ve never felt so alive as an
adult. I feel more energy to do everything that comes my way. This
experience combined with the insights from this book gives me the
knowledge that &lsquo;open floor plans&rsquo; are not my cup-of-tea.
They overstimulate the heck out of me, and it had the impact on me
that I was so drained at the end of the workday that I had to
recharge when it was done. Which gave me no leverage for any other
social interactions outside of work (or at least very rarely).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;ve always had trouble with small talk,
especially in big groups. They both do not interest me, and I do not
feel engaged. Since extravert is the perceived &lsquo;norm&rsquo; it
also gave me the feeling of &lsquo;being unconnected from the group&rsquo;
and therefore either not fitting it or being left out. Also I seemed
allot more serious than most people I encounter. Them either being
extraverted or pseudo-extraverted. But sometimes I seem to instantly
click with someone. I understand now that if the other person is not
full blown extraverted or is &lsquo;mature enough&rsquo; to be open
for a deeper conversation, I can connect much easier. This also gives
me the feeling that: you know&hellip; sometimes its okay to just take
it easy and put on that extravert mask and go with the flow. But now
I do know that that is precisely the thing that does drain my energy,
so use it sparingly and for situations in which I get joy out of it,
or make steps in some personal project.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>This gives me a huge new insight in how to plan my live so that I
can feel happy, energetic, connected, effective and stay on course
with the projects that make me feel engaged. And know that If some
event happens that drains my energy, I might need a few days to
recover, but now I understand why this happens. Which makes me feel
comfortable in what I do and who I am.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>As an example to this, sometimes it is very busy at the gym where
I do rock climbing. If the day or previous days have been
overstimulating, I do feel the need to get some physical exercise in,
but I feel it hard to engage myself with the people at the gym, which
on a &lsquo;normal not overstimulated day&rsquo; is quite easy to do.
And so on those days, I used to feel like &lsquo;something was wrong
with me, I am not in it today&rsquo; because being overstimulated
also affected my climbing performance. Now I understand where this
comes from, and it is okay to slow down and take a step back. Either
stay at home and recharge, or engage only lightly and maybe go to the
gym with some headphones on to stay in my own little bubble as I go.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Ethos, Pathos, Logos</h3>
<p>Though not directly referenced in the book, the methodology of how
to communicate effectively is mentioned more than once. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Ethos I would describe as &lsquo;Unify&rsquo;. To unify, or become
one, you have to gain trust, respect or any other form of connection
from the other participants. By investing your time and energy into
their experiences or thoughts. Through this investment a bond is
created between all participants in which you can later reach your
personal goals that help the whole resulting unit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Pathos, also described as &lsquo;showing empathy&rsquo;, I would
describe as internalize. You are trying to reach some personal goal,
but in order to do that you require the participation of someone
else. In order to understand how to persuade them, you have to
understand how your goal will affect them. Will it be positive? Or
maybe negative? And if negative, do you understand why, and what
alternatives exist that would go for a win-win.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Logos, being logic. Is where you have reached both a bond with the
other participant and have figured out a win-win solution you can
then present. It will be accepted with open arms through the bond and
since it is altered to meet their needs it has a very high chance of
success, or at the very least open up ways for further discussion in
which they are engaged positively.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>After having read Quiet, I feel like this is the way introverts
tend to communicate. Looking at myself. I can say I do not. And this
actually saddens me. I have thought myself to be very &lsquo;extraverted&rsquo;
in this sense. I portray may &lsquo;solution&rsquo; before engaging
with the participants. I do this by elevating myself, in posture and
voice. And make myself very confident. Regularly I get reminded that
I am very imposing when I &lsquo;act&rsquo; like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>And to be fair, I do it all the time, but I don&rsquo;t like doing
it. It has become a habit I need to shake off. It takes allot of
energy out of me to put on that mask and fake it till I make it.
Where I would rather open up a deep conversation and use my mind,
intellect and the shared time to bond and grow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Thin boundary</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always struggled allot with controlling what I feel in
relation to what other people feel. When I see someone sad, I get
sad. When someone is angry, I get angry. But the worst of all, when I
see someone is stressed, I get stressed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Now actually this can be a very good source of information. When I
talk to someone I know what they feel by evaluation myself. The hard
part of this is that I also experience these emotions myself. In my
private life this is not that compromising. I know I should steer
clear of very stimulation video&rsquo;s on the internet where people
engage negatively with each other because it will make me go through
their roller coaster of emotions, which can be very draining and
detracting of exposed to that for a long period of time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>At work how ever, throughout my adult live I have always
experienced colleagues under huge amounts of stress. Even if they
themselves don&rsquo;t know it, don&rsquo;t realize it, or
(un)consciously choose to ignore it. This has to this day been my
biggest source of stress, and feels like these experiences have made
true the biggest set backs in my professional career. I don&rsquo;t
handle stress rather well, especially If I&rsquo;m already drained
from prolonged exposure to over stimulation. And have lead to very
negative experiences at work. (especially combined with my fake
extravert mask of confidence)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Knowing what I know now, I am very happy to have read this book,
and the breathing room Covid-19 has giving me by making it possible
to work from home, and giving my headspace to evaluate myself and my
feelings. For the future, I need to question myself if what I am
feeling are feelings of my own, or what I experience through empathy
from the people around me. And then question what I want to do with
that. The thing I wish to experience the least of all is stress. So I
think, in situation where I experience stress, I need to share how I
feel and what I am experiencing. And gather if this feeling is
shared. If so, to ask for help to remove the feeling of stress
mutually, or ask for distance from this situation as it feels
unhealthy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Different inherit traits to intro and extraverted
&ndash; Self monitoring</h3>
<p>Extraverted people tend to be more reward oriented, where
introverted people tend to be more intrinsically motivated by some
project or process. Doing the work itself tends to be the motivation
introverts seek. Introverted people tend to be more serious and
focused. Introverted people tend to think about the potential &lsquo;what
if&rsquo; where extraverted people tend to think in the &lsquo;what
is&rsquo;. Introverted people tend to exert cognitive capacity
monitoring themselves in a process, where extraverted people focus
fully on the process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Having read this, true or not, it makes allot of sense from my
perspective. In my hobby (bouldering,  gaming and software
development) or where ever my passion lays. I grow continuously
simply by being myself. Though I notice that which comes naturally to
me, does not come naturally to everyone around me. With some of my
friends I notice the same &lsquo;feedback&rsquo; mechanism, but far
from all. I suppose this is because the feedback mechanism only kicks
in for subjects we are truly passionate about. So if I am passionate
about bouldering but other people are only doing it leisurely, then
the feedback mechanism that kicks in for me where I actively monitor
myself and the process I am preforming, does not kick in for them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>It sometimes boggles my mind that very smart people I meet at
bouldering seem to try the same thing over and over again without
actively looking at themselves and reflect on what is going wrong and
learn from their experiences. I assume now that this means they are
either more extraverted and want the &lsquo;quick win&rsquo; and
simply try to brute force their way to victory. Or this is simply not
their passion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Truth in silence</h3>
<p>I tend to speak allot, but not only when &lsquo;its my turn to
talk&rsquo;. Also when someone else is explaining something and is
thinking for a moment, I tend to fill the gap with an assertion or
question. I think this is actually a very bad habit. Silence leads to
truth by letting the natural thought process continue uninterrupted.
Plus, if there falls a true silence, who ever spoke last tends to
fill the hole with more information anyways. And usually this
information is not prepared, so it helps you and them &lsquo;get to
the bottom of things&rsquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I think, remaining silent in a conversation is not &lsquo;shy&rsquo;
but true listening. Two ears, one mouth is a saying I hear. Listen
twice as much as you speak. And I think that makes allot of sense
when you are the listening, or helping/coaching/parenting, one in a
conversation. Let the other explain their point of view and feelings
uninterrupted.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Rejection sensitive</h3>
<p>This one has opened my eyes to a new view point to look at myself.
I always thought I was either shy or very insecure. These are broad
terms and that is why they did not seem to fit, but I didn&rsquo;t
have some more specific to name what I experienced. Rejection
sensitive labels it well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>For example, I do shy away from new interactions, but I don&rsquo;t
let it hold me back, it just takes a little but more energy to do so
and in environments I feel comfortable it takes no energy at all,
sometimes even happens fluidly. Because of that, I would not say I am
very shy. The same goes for insecure, I am rather confident at my
skills in general, be it software development or other activities.
Rather, I am quite persistent in reaching goals and finishing
projects &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; I can do them, if taking the time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Yet still these same experiences can be very overstimulating when
inserting a different aspect to them. Reflecting now on latest
experiences where I felt very overstimulated and had to back out of a
situation or take time off work. It was because, in the background,
or perceived by me, there was the aspect of potentially being
rejected. After having reflected I now know that these situations
hosted all sorts of history and perceived emotions that could make me
be rejected out of a group that I was processing unconsciously.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>And at that moment, other than being very &lsquo;insecure&rsquo;
and very overstimulated, I did not know this was going on. Though I
think this is a very tricky one to master, I can&rsquo;t simply ask
myself &lsquo;How do I feel&rsquo;, I also have to know &lsquo;Why do
I feel that way&rsquo;. So that I can handle these situations
appropriately, and not feel overstimulated by my emotions, but by
understanding them give myself head space. I hope that in due time I
can become adept at understanding these emotions.</p>
<h3 class="western">Character and Personal Projects</h3>
<p>In Quiet, a difference is drawn between how introverts and
extraverts tend to function in daily life. Where extraverts are goal
oriented and work on their &lsquo;perceived&rsquo; personality.
Introverts stay with their character and work on their personal
projects. I think this rings very true for me. Looking at my life the
past few years where I got more into my own. Even though I spend most
of this time alone, I never feel alone or bored.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I am always propelled by some interest in some subject, some
activity that helps me further a project or other activities. Outside
that, bouldering to have some social interaction and together it
leaves me physically so drained that in the few hours I do nothing I
have to lay down and rest my head. Doing this feels like I am doing
what I wish to do. How I feel most myself. Yet when I look around it,
it differs from what I perceive to be the norm. Though this is hard
to judge because &lsquo;personal projects&rsquo; can be anything. For
me, it being the maintaining of my body and mind and furthering these
skills in order to give back to the community (first step, my website
through sharing my findings). But for other people this may be the
family they have started, which of course can be a future project of
mine, so it is really hard to say.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>But I am happy to have made this realization and feel more relaxed
about the fact that I can just listen to myself, my feelings and
thoughts and go with what they drive me to do. And not feel
&lsquo;obligated&rsquo; to do something else.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Free Trait</h3>
<p>In Quiet it is described that even though introverts tend to be
seclusive and shy people they are able to leave their &lsquo;true
self&rsquo; to achieve some goal. Let&rsquo;s say you are very shy,
but your project is help your community through hosting events and
bringing people together, creating a sense of community. To do this,
you sometimes have to be&hellip; not shy, be bold. For an introvert
this can be very exhausting to &lsquo;fake it, to make it&rsquo;, but
as long as it is in the pursuit of some personal project. This is
fine, it is not &lsquo;a fake mask&rsquo;. You are just temporarily
altering your character in the pursuit of your own wishes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Free Trait Agreement</h3>
<p>Though, since changing your character can be exhausting, it has to
be &lsquo;managed&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s say for some project you have
to host an event and have to be very socially interactive for an
afternoon. But this drains you for a week. The agreement is just
that, give yourself the space to recover from changing your character
for a set limit, and feel okay about that fact. Instead of feeling
guilty that you &lsquo;lock yourself up in your house for a week&rsquo;
see it as an investment in order to &lsquo;be that different
character again when the next opportunity arrives&rsquo; though at
the same time staying true to yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>If you do not adhere to the agreement you make with yourself (or
not even setting it up) you will probably overstimulate yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Stay true to yourself (in all environments)</h3>
<p>One of the biggest realizations I&rsquo;ve made due to this book,
is that generally when I&rsquo;m out and about (especially work
related) I put on a mask of an extravert. While this is okay
occasionally, it tends to drain me allot. So not only does it not
pursue any personal projects, it also has the opposite effect of
being a very grumpy extravert.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>This is not me, because when I am in environments where I do not
feel I have to put on a mask, I am a very different person. Hence, I
am not staying true to myself. I am a bit shy, I am confident in my
skills, knowledge, intellect and physical ability. I am studious. I
am observant. I am emotional and empathic. I am easily
overstimulated. This is who I am, and I need not feel lesser for it.
I can speak about how I feel when I notice a strong emotion, and that
is alright.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">The duality of me</h3>
<p>While reading this book and its stories of peoples youths, I&rsquo;ve
been thinking of my own and where certain things changed. When I was
young, I was not the person I am today, but that person I was when I
was young, is me. At elementary school I was playful, but studious. I
cried easily when emotional things happened to me and I was terrified
of big crowds. I was very observant and new information was easily
absorbed. I rarely had to study to get good grades because questions
only has one logical answer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>In elementary school, I was not the big guy. I was always shortest
and youngest in class. Occasionally bullied, but in general I have a
feeling It was okay. Even hanging out with my &lsquo;bullies&rsquo;.
Though I think I am also very impressionable. Even though I got
bullied, I studied their behavior in order to &lsquo;fit in&rsquo;,
and get bullied less. But of course, since people have a certain
&lsquo;view&rsquo; of you that does not easily change, you can only
change that few so much before reaching some ceiling. But every time
I got bullied, it left an impression not easily changed (I see now in
retrospect)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>After elementary school, I saw an opportunity that new people, new
environments, though scary, are also an opportunity for a fresh start
to be on the &lsquo;winning side&rsquo; and not be bullied. In the
transition from elementary school and middle school I changed my
&lsquo;mask&rsquo; and was a bit more &lsquo;in with the bullies&rsquo;,
though there were always bigger bullies of the more senior years.
These were better years, though not without being bullied. I still
remember some guy, a bit older of a little more southern heritage
named &lsquo;Gabriel&rsquo; who was bullying a shy kid and punching
him square in the shoulder. The kid cried out a little. Gabriel
turned to me and asked &lsquo;This doesn&rsquo;t hurt does it?&rsquo;
and punched me in the shoulder same as the other kid. My body
recoiled a bit to the side, but my mask was fixed &ldquo;Nah man&rdquo;.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>(When thinking back about this experience, my gut feeling is
telling me that &lsquo;the next time I see him I&rsquo;ll punch him
so hard he HAS to tell me it hurts&rsquo;. But&hellip; nah, this is
not his fault. He did what he thought he needed to do to survive,
grow, and go through life. He was actually quite a thoughtful guy
when it came to it, he just had these tendencies&hellip; like me, to
put on a different mask from time to time. And since I had a mask on
that &lsquo;made me seem like I can take it&rsquo;. I made the
situation come to be. He and I, are both are fault)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Again, these years I tended to gravitate more towards the semi
safe heavens of the bullies together with a few more serious minded
and quieter friends. Only one in particular stuck throughout the
years, mostly because he was the most intriguing and serious minded.
Something I can connect with. (even though at the time I can imagine
I was most certainly not that serious myself). His name was Maarten.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Through middle school into high school I followed him and (at the
time a close friend) Terry in software development. It was not
something I was initially very interested in, but after doing it for
10 years professionally, I am very happy they introduced me to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my high school experience was very
impressionable on my personality. It was quite a relaxed experience,
I could do what I want and had a group of friends that were mostly
&lsquo;go with the flow&rsquo;. Lunches were spend with the more
quiet and easy going friends, Maarten usually a part of it and Tobby
and Roger joined the group, Terry left to hang with the &lsquo;cool
kids&rsquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>During the 3<sup>rd</sup> year of high school I had to go on
internship, and this made a lot more responsible. But I am getting
off track.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I think in the transaction and experience of middle school, the
whole &lsquo;trying to fit in with the bullies&rsquo; of my
elementary school was the wrong choose to find a safe heaven that has
left a lasting experience that still effects me today. I know, that
showing weakness is not something I easily do today, from what I&rsquo;ve
learned in my youth it means opening one self up for the bullies that
take advantage from such weakness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Luckily, today I am a strong self sustaining adult. I know that
showing such weaknesses is actually a sign of strength. Stronger than
the superficial shell of the bullies. Going out bare chested and
showing all your weaknesses and scars and saying &lsquo;this is me&rsquo;
is allot stronger than having plated armor, because they are heavy,
and drain allot more energy, and in general you don&rsquo;t need that
on a day-to-day business.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>But&hellip; even though I know that, I notice I am still very
quick to go back to what I learned in elementary school, don&rsquo;t
show weakness, be quick to respond, put other people down before they
get a chance to put you down. Sigh, even while typing this I feel
ashamed that I&rsquo;ve done that for so long. Even when I know I
want to extend a helping hand I feel overwhelmed when the helping
hand does not help them quick enough because I am taking too much
time to help them and so it is their fault and they need to be put
down because they can shame me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be that guy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>One of my biggest life projects is to give back to the community.
I think that is very honorable. How I wish to do that is still a
mystery, but every step, every bit of research into tranquility and
some field helps me become a balanced person. And this knowledge and
experience is something I can and will pass on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Shutting other people out&hellip; does not help that project.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I still struggle between the personally that I created for myself
at a young age &lsquo;to survive&rsquo; and the person I am. I want
to be who I am, but I have to release the shackles of who I trained
myself to be. It is funny that when playing games I notice I also
have this duality in personality. Call them, Littlesneak and
Humanshield. Which are the two nicknames I choose for them.
Littlesneak would be the quiet observant guy that strikes when the
time is right, and humanshield is the &lsquo;hey look at me, I&rsquo;m
strong and on the forefront, throw everything you got at me, I&rsquo;ll
take it for those who cannot&rsquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>And though Humanshield is created out of the honorable image that
I can take any and all challenges thrown my way and &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
best it&rsquo;. It is not who I am. I would be very overstimulated
doing that, and very unhappy because I would not be working on any
project that interests me. Yet I&rsquo;ve lived my whole teen and
adult life trying to be &lsquo;Humanshield&rsquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I know now, Littlesneak is who I am, inside and out, at work or at
home, in public or in private. He is observant, and strikes when the
time is right. He is quiet, thoughtful, studious, emphatic and
emotional. And that is who I am.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Conclusion</h3>
<p>What I want to accomplish is that I stop being that &lsquo;Humanshield&rsquo;
and come back to who I am, &lsquo;Littlesneak&rsquo;. But how do I
accomplish this?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I have a few thought experiments in mind.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Firstly, I&rsquo;ve noticed that I tend to overthink potential
futures and possible conversations (in order to be prepared and &lsquo;best
everyone else&rsquo;). This type of preparation both overstimulates
me, and tends to disconnect me when the conversation actually
happens. Because I don&rsquo;t listen anymore, I just respond with
the closest scenario I have prepared in my mind. As a counter, I
sometimes limit my thoughts back to having to start with &lsquo;I&rsquo;&hellip;
I feel, I think, I want. What ever it is, it has to be about me. This
snaps me out of my head and back into the real world. When I start
doing this, I suddenly feel like I see the world again, and that I am
in control, instead of these potential futures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to stop myself every now and then and just ask
&lsquo;Hey me, how are you feeling?&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve noticed that I
tend to become very overzealous in activities and not reflect on how
I feel. Sometimes I am thirsty for hours on end without realizing it.
But also, I am sometimes very overwhelmed and I just keep pushing
(humanshield), instead of stopping and asking &lsquo;What do I really
want to do?&rsquo;, and act on the answer, no matter what it is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Thirdly, I want to talk more about how I feel. Due to my thin
skin, I tend to be quickly overwhelmed (especially in work related
conversations). But I used to not talk about this and just push
through (humanshield). What I really want to do is stop the
conversation and talk about how we feel. If we are stressed out, why
is that, and can we alleviate this before continuing our
conversation? And if we cannot resolve or justify these feelings, can
we stop this conversation all together, it is overwhelming me?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I think especially that last one is very important. Because it is
how the world will perceive me. It might show me a bit &lsquo;weaker&rsquo;,
but to be fair, I think I will be a much more genuine person for it.
I have a feeling that if I can talk like that, a much better bond
will be shaped and trust will be build. Also for that reason I think
it will be the most difficult to do. But I can do it. And I will.</p>

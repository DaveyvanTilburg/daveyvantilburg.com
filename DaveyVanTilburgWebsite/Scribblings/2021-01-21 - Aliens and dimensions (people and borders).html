<p>Okay, the title is a bit supernatural, but I mean it more as a way
of perceiving the world. My cat feels less alien to me than my
neighbor who is human. There are also communities in which I feel
less alien, than I feel in others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I was thinking about this, because I was meditating and thoughts
crossed my mind about the situation the world is in right now. The
corona crises and people being either supportive or opposing one
movement or another, the elections coming our way and the lack of
love for one another during these trying times. Or at least, that is
how I perceive the situation. I was thinking about how order and
chaos mixes in with all of this. As the measurements to &lsquo;take
control of the pandemic&rsquo; are getting more and more invasive.
And you may argue that once &lsquo;full control&rsquo; is
established, the situation can be dealt with. But what does full
control mean?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>Full control, I think, is theoretically probable but hard to
realize (actually more in the lines of nigh impossible, because
people are rarely aware of how they see the world, to accurately
predict what they will feel in the future, let alone now). And if a
consensus is made, time moves on, people come across a myriad of
unforeseen changes in their lives that evolve into different &ldquo;better&rdquo;
tomorrows in which new &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; arises to compete with the
established &ldquo;order&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>In a way, you could say that everyone is traveling live through
their own &ldquo;dimension&rdquo;, their own slice of reality. And
yes, if every molecule and thought in the physical and subjective
world could be controlled, then it would be possible to create
&ldquo;order&rdquo;. Yet this leaves no room for chaos, no room to
cultivate or evolve. I think that is bad. I value uniqueness and
challenges of every size.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>I think, leaving a bit of room for both order, and chaos
(yin-yang) is what we need to strive for. Realizing that this
alienates people. Because some, from their own dimension, will see
only chaos and request more order, while others see only order and
request more chaos. This alienation is around us always. And I think,
that is something we need to integrate into our paradigm. Something
to be at peace with. And realize that whatever is happening: people
are rarely in your dimension. So reach out to them so they can see
the world the way you see it, and be curious as to what their
dimension looks like. So for a brief moment in time, you might get a
true connection with another Being in this world, and realize that
this moment is fleeting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p>And I think that that is beautiful, and has its place in the
world. It gives meaning to action. Realizing someone is questioning
you, so they may see the world the way you do, to take a glimpse into
your dimension. Means that someone who is alien to you, is trying to
be human. That is a form of love. And that needs to be valued. Lest
the world stay alien to you, and you live in solitude in your
dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I&rsquo;ve come to
realize recently that long ago, I&rsquo;ve read a (fictional) story
about a general that was exiled for his believes, and the
consequences thereof. I wish to share this story, and give my
interpretation of it. It is the backstory from one of the characters
of the game Demigod named &lsquo;The Oak&rsquo;:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Thanos
the Immortal was King Nimoth XII's favorite captain, as he had been
for his father and his father's father. Thanos was renowned for his
loyalty, his leadership, his skill with an axe, and above all his
very great age. Leading several generations of soldiers in the wars
of the Nimoth Dynasties, Thanos had received countless death-blows,
but none had killed him. His men had rallied many times at the sight
of Thanos rising again after being stricken down by his enemy.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Thanos,
who wore his armor and helm at all times, was rumored to have been
horribly disfigured by the centuries of battle-scars he had received
in the service of the Nimoth Kings. At court, he was a stoic,
monolithic presence, only speaking when addressed.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>It
was therefore a great shock when Thanos refused his Lord's command to
fight at the Battle of Rond. The usually-noisy court fell immediately
silent when Thanos' voice boomed from within his helmet: &quot;this
cannot rightly be called 'a battle,' my Lord. The Rondish folk may be
resistant to taxation, some may even be treacherous, but they are not
warriors. Most of their men are away at harvest. Our army will only
find women and children at Rond.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>&quot;All
the better,&quot; replied the king. &quot;Let us purge these
undesirables now and never again suffer their insolence.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Thanos'
helmet turned toward the king. &quot;Your fathers were also vexed by
the proud Rondish, but they used other methods. They would never have
ordered a massacre of innocents.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>The
king stood, his cheeks crimson with rage. &quot;I am not my father,
and you will do as I say! Disobey me now, and I will banish you for a
thousand years!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Thanos'
black visor looked for a moment upon the king, and then he spoke. &quot;As
you wish. I will go.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>It
was thus that Thanos and the five hundred vassals of his house found
themselves in exile among the Writh-tal, the Canyons of the Dead. The
Canyons cut through a blighted, broken land, and were inhabited by
terrible Dead Things. These would not abide the living, and the
king's proclamation had almost certainly meant death for Thanos'
servants.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Nevertheless,
the remnants of the House of Thanos survived long enough to build a
fortress upon a great, tortured rock. When the walls were complete,
Thanos stood watch at the gate, guarding the stronghold's only
approach. Undead things sometimes made attempts upon the fortress,
but he vanquished them all. As gatekeeper to a sumptuous island of
life a midst a hungry sea of death, he came into contact with many
Dead Things from the other side, some of which had once also been
alive. The Undead Things saw that they shared with Thanos both exile
and lonely immortality, and some did not hate him.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Nine
hundred years later, Thanos still kept his station, rooted to the
spot like a great dark tree. As generations passed and Thanos'
vassals looked down upon his unmoving figure beneath the parapet,
they gave him a new name: The Oak.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Attacks
by Dead Things had abated in recent times, and some of the youngest
children had never seen the Oak move. They doubted the stories told
to them by their parents, suspecting instead that the great armored
statue beyond the gate was some kind of scarecrow for ghosts.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Then
one gray morning a new and dreadful Dead Thing, a Dark Servant from
beyond the Veil, fell upon the stronghold. The Oak took up his axe
and rushed out to meet the abomination. Though he landed many blows
upon the thing, the Oak could not bring it down. The giant attacker
had many arms and many weapons, and the Oak could not break through
its defenses. In the end, the Dark Servant raised a great hooked club
above its head and brought the weapon down upon the Oak, shattering
him. His horrified vassals saw his armor scatter, and also saw that
it contained no body.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Satisfied
that the Oak was no more, The Dark Servant turned to the undefended
stronghold, licking its many lips in anticipation of the succulent
souls within.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>Wisps
of blue fog formed among the scattered remnants of the Oak's armor,
and slowly each part moved across the ground, reconnecting to its
neighbors. When at last the Oak's form was restored, he rose to his
feet and took up his axe. For the first time in centuries, he spoke
aloud:</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>&quot;Warrior
spirits, fellow exiles, hear me! Remember the fragility of those you
loved, remember the noble causes for which you fought! Here is a
worthy battle and a formidable foe! Rise with me now!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>From
the ground around the Oak rose floating, spectral forms, growing in
number until they flew in great swarms towards the Dark Servant.
Screaming, the many-armed demon lashed out in all directions, but
could not repel the clouds of angry spirits that engulfed it.
Distracted by the onslaught, the Dark Servant did not see the Oak
running towards him, picking up speed and raising his axe. The Oak
leaped into the air and sank his weapon into the demon's chest,
revealing its withered black heart. He reached inside and ripped it
free, throwing it over the precipice. The Dark Servant bellowed one
last time, then sank to the ground and moved no more.</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

swirling spirits circled the Oak, then faded away as dawn broke. The
Oak then dragged the demon's corpse to the edge of the canyon and
pushed it into the abyss. His vassals cheered from the stronghold,
calling out his name.</i></font></p>

gave them neither sign nor word. Once again taking his place by the
gate, he planted his axe-handle in the ground and set his shield
before him, looking out over the hostile wastes of the Writh-tal.</i></font></p>

could interpret &lsquo;The Oak&rsquo; as the embodiment of an ideal,
an idea, a vision or anything of the sort. Also described by the fact
that when the armor breaks nothing is inside, but it can reshape
itself. Which is metaphorically like an idea because any person can
hold on to an idea, and when you &lsquo;break&rsquo; the person, you
have only broken an embodiment of the idea, not the idea itself. Much
like the movie &lsquo;V for Vendetta&rsquo; where the main character
says &ldquo;Idea&rsquo;s are bulletproof&rdquo;.</span></font></p>

the representation of virtue and the upholding of a moral code, the
idea, when asked to &ldquo;do as I say or be exiled&rdquo; has only
one option. To choose to be exiled. Because if the idea did anything
else, it would no longer be virtues, and would break its moral code
if it were to go &ldquo;against the king&rdquo;. As the king is not a
soldier.</font></p>

nothing more than the pure embodiment of an idea, he simply follows
his own code like a &lsquo;stoic&rsquo;. Where a &ldquo;mere human&rdquo;
would most likely doubt, because choosing exile means hardship for
not only you, but everyone representing the idea.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The fact that the Oak chooses
exile without second thought and his vassals follow him into hardship
is something we as modern people need to look up to. Even though this
is merely fiction, the idea of &ldquo;having a view of the world for
how it should be&rdquo; and not stray away from that view as soon as
brings hardship your way, is a way of saying &ldquo;to have a
backbone&rdquo;. To have a vision and be able to execute it to the
best of your abilities.</font></p>

of saying that &ldquo;the strong&rdquo; (as in, those who have a
refined mortal compass and a backbone to support it) will find others
with that same strength and share a connection due to their, lets
say, aura. Even though apart from this strength, nothing is shared.</font></p>

warriors meeting in battle, both of age, of experience and having
withstand many hardships, might meet and feel a mutual respect, even
though they defend different ideals. And due to this respect, will
deal with their enclosed battle differently then they might another.
They might fight to win the engagement and break off before killing
the other. As a small token to their connection.</font></p>

the first shot because it is the most accurate and would tip the tide
